# About me

I am professor of Natural Language Processing at the [University of Osnabr√ºck](https://www.uni-osnabrueck.de/startseite/).

Previously, I was a [Marie Sklodowska-Curie Fellow](https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/) at the [Computational Linguistics and 
Linguistic Theory (COLT) research group](https://www.upf.edu/web/colt), [University of Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/) (Barcelona, Spain).

I obtained my PhD at the [Language, Interaction and Computation Lab (CLIC)](http://clic.cimec.unitn.it/) at the 
University of Trento. My research is in the areas of natural language 
processing, computer vision and machine learning. In the past, I extracted distributional semantic models from pictures and 
merged them with traditional text-based semantic representations. 

Together with 
[Dieuwke Hupkes](http://dieuwkehupkes.nl/),
I am coordinating [i-machine-think](http://i-machine-think.github.io) lab.
