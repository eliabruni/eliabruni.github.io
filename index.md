# About me

I am currently a [Marie Sklodowska-Curie Fellow](https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/) at the [Computational Linguistics and 
Linguistic Theory (COLT) research group](https://www.upf.edu/web/colt), [University of Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/) (Barcelona, Spain).

Previously, I was Postdoc at the 
[Dialogue Modelling Group](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/r.fernandezrovira/dialogue-group.php)
led by [Raquel Fern√°ndez](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/r.fernandezrovira/), [ILLC](http://www.illc.uva.nl/), 
University of Amsterdam.

I obtained my PhD at the [Language, Interaction and Computation Lab (CLIC)](http://clic.cimec.unitn.it/) at the 
University of Trento. My research is in the areas of natural language 
processing, computer vision and machine learning. In the past, I extracted distributional semantic models from pictures and 
merged them with traditional text-based semantic representations. 

At ILLC I am building 
neural conversational agents that learn via visual games. Together with 
[Dieuwke Hupkes](http://dieuwkehupkes.nl/),
I am also coordinating [i-machine-think](https://github.com/i-machine-think), 
a project about compositionality in neural networks.
