### Welcome!

I obtained my PhD at the Language, Interaction and Computation Lab at the 
University of Trento. My research is in the areas of natural language 
processing, computer vision and machine learning. At ILLC I am building 
neural conversational agents using generative adversarial networks. I am 
also interested in grounding the meaning of words in the visual world. 
In the past, I extracted distributional semantic models from pictures and 
merged them with traditional text-based semantic representations. At ILLC, 
I am planning to do visual grounding using neural language models, within a 
semi-supervised setting. 

I am also in the managment committee of the ICT COST Action IC1307 - The European 
Network on Integrating Vision and Language.
