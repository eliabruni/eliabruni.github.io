# About me

I am Postdoc at the 
[Dialogue Modelling Group](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/r.fernandezrovira/dialogue-group.php)
led by [Raquel Fern√°ndez](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/r.fernandezrovira/), [ILLC](http://www.illc.uva.nl/), 
University of Amsterdam.

I obtained my PhD at the Language, Interaction and Computation Lab at the 
University of Trento. My research is in the areas of natural language 
processing, computer vision and machine learning. In the past, I extracted distributional semantic models from pictures and 
merged them with traditional text-based semantic representations. 

At ILLC I am building 
neural conversational agents that learn via visual games. Together with 
[Dieuwke Hupkes](http://dieuwkehupkes.nl/),
I am also coordinating [i-machine-think](http://i-machine-think.github.io/), 
a project about compositionality in neural networks.
